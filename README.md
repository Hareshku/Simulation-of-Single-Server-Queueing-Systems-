This project presents a **simulation modeling system** designed to analyze and optimize **single-server queueing problems** in real-world service environments. The system simulates how customers arrive, wait, and get served at a service counter such as in **a bank, grocery store, hospital reception**, or **customer support center**. It models realistic waiting line behavior using probabilistic distributions for **inter-arrival times** and **service times**.

The system allows users to either:

Input random numbers manually, or

Auto-generate random numbers automatically through the program.

This flexibility helps users experiment with different datasets and conditions for better understanding of queue dynamics.

The simulation was tested for 10, 15, 20, and 100 customers, but it can easily be adjusted to handle any number of customers based on user requirements. It computes important performance metrics such as:

Average waiting time

Total time spent in the system

Maximum queue length

Waiting and service start times of specific customers

Time spent by individual customers in the system

This project demonstrates the power of discrete-event simulation in evaluating service efficiency, identifying bottlenecks, and improving customer experience in environments where waiting and service time are uncertain.
