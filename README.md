This project presents a **simulation modeling system** designed to analyze and optimize **single-server queueing problems** in real-world service environments. The system simulates how customers arrive, wait, and get served at a service counter such as in **a bank, grocery store, hospital reception**, or **customer support center**. It models realistic waiting line behavior using probabilistic distributions for **inter-arrival times** and **service times**.

The system allows users to either:

- **Input random numbers manually**, or

- **Auto-generate random numbers** automatically through the program.

This flexibility helps users experiment with different datasets and conditions for better understanding of queue dynamics.

The simulation was tested for **10, 15, 20, and 100 customers**, but it can easily be adjusted to handle any number of customers based on user requirements. It computes important performance metrics such as:

- Average waiting time

- Total time spent in the system

- Maximum queue length

- Waiting and service start times of specific customers

- Time spent by individual customers in the system

This project demonstrates the power of **discrete-event simulation** in evaluating service efficiency, identifying bottlenecks, and improving customer experience in environments where waiting and service time are uncertain.
